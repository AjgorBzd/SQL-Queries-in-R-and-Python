This assignment was focused on learning the Python *pandas* package, as well as revising the *numpy* functions we learned during the semester.

The ability to chain commands one after another, similarly to piping in *dplyr*, provides the same instructions in smaller space, also making the code more readable and comprehensive. Moreover, fulfilling this project was a valuable experience gained in the field of Python programming."
